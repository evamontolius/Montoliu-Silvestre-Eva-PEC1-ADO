Study Title	The rumen metagenome and its metabolome in yaks associated with feeding regime
Study Description	<p>Background: Grazing yearly on pasture is a traditional practice for yaks, which cannot meet the requirements of yak products since the insufficient forage supplied in the cold season results in a long production cycle. An intensive feeding system increasing production efficiency has been selected for beef and dairy cattle. However, its impacts on yaks are less studied, and it is unclear how the rumen microbiome, rumen metabolites and the host metabolome respond to an intensive feeding system and contribute to yak growth. Here, multi-omics, including rumen metagenomics, rumen and plasma metabolomics, were performed to classify the effects and regulatory mechanisms of intensive feeding system.</p><p>Results: In our results, increased growth performance and rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration were observed in yaks under the intensive feeding system compared to yaks grazing on pastures. Metagenomics of the rumen microbiome revealed that species of Clostridium and Methanobrevibacter as well as Piromyces sp. E2 and Anaeromyces robustus were increased in the rumen of intensively fed yaks, interacting and contributing to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. The rumen of yaks grazing on pasture had more cellulolytic microbes, such as Bacteroides and Fibrobacter species. Moreover, yaks under the intensive feeding system had lower methanogen and increased methane degradation functions, suggesting that the methane emission of these yaks may be decreased. These abundant microbiomes were correlated with the pathways of “Alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism” and “Pyruvate metabolism”. Similar with rumen VFA results, metabolomics found that intensively fed yaks had greater concentrations of metabolites related to carbohydrates. The methyl metabolites associated with methane production were greater in the rumen of yak grazing on pasture. Additionally, these changed rumen microbiomes and their metabolites resulted in changes in plasma metabolome, finally affecting yaks’ growth.</p><p>Conclusions: This study compressively classifies the mechanism that an intensive feeding system benefits yak production and reveals the importance of the rumen microbiome for host metabolism and performance. These findings evidence that an intensive feeding system could be used for the yak industry.</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>A total of 50 healthy Zhongdian yaks aged 3 to 4 years old were selected and divided into two treatments. One treatment group was traditionally grazed all day on the natural ranch (Grazing group), while the other group was reared under an intensive feeding system (Intensive group) that housed and fed a total mixed ration diet to yaks. The trial lasted 60 days. At the end of the trial, fourteen yaks were randomly selected from two treatments to collect samples for downstream analysis (e.g., blood parameters, rumen fermentation parameters and multi-omics), with seven bulls in each group.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>An oral stomach tube was used for the collection of rumen content samples. In brief, at 8 am in the morning, a tube was inserted into the rumen, and a vacuum sampler was used to pump rumen fluid. The first 30 mL of rumen digesta sample to avoid saliva contamination was thrown away. For each animal, 30 ml of rumen fluid was collected, and divided into three parts placed into 10 ml polypropylene tubes. Then, all samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and brought back to the laboratory for long-term storage at -80 °C.&nbsp;</p>	<p>100 μL of sample was transferred to an EP tube. After the addition of 400 μL of extract solution (acetonitrile: methanol = 1: 1, containing isotopically-labelled internal standard mixture), the samples were vortexed for 30 s, sonicated for 5 min in ice-water bath, and incubated for 1 h at -40 ℃ to precipitate proteins. Then the sample was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh glass vial for analysis. The quality control (QC) sample was prepared by mixing an equal aliquot of the supernatants from all of the samples.</p>	<p>LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using an UHPLC system (Vanquish, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). The mobile phase consisted of 25 mmol/L ammonium acetate and 25 ammonia hydroxide in water (pH 9.75) (A) and acetonitrile (B). The analysis was carried with elution gradient as follows: 0~0.5 min, 95%B; 0.5~7.0 min, 95%~65% B; 7.0~8.0 min, 65%~40% B; 8.0~9.0 min, 40% B; 9.0~9.1 min, 40%~95% B; 9.1~12.0 min, 95% B. The column temperature was 25 °C. The auto-sampler temperature was 4 °C, and the injection volume was 2 μL.</p>	<p>The Q Exactive HFX mass spectrometer was used for its ability to acquire MS/MS spectra on information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode in the control of the acquisition software (Xcalibur, Thermo). The acquisition software continuously evaluates the full scan MS spectrum in this mode. The ESI source conditions were set as follows: sheath gas flow rate as 50 Arb, Aux gas flow rate as 10 Arb, capillary temperature 320 °C, full MS resolution as 60000, MS/MS resolution as 7500, collision energy as 10/30/60 in NCE mode, spray Voltage as 3.5 kV (positive).&nbsp; </p>	<p>The raw data of metabolomics was converted to the mzXML format using ProteoWizard and processed with an in-house program, which was developed using R and based on XCMS, for peak detection, extraction, alignment, and integration.&nbsp;</p>	<p>an in-house MS2 database (BiotreeDB) was applied to metabolite annotation.&nbsp;</p>
